## 💡 Problem Solved

Finding the right gift for someone can often be overwhelming — especially when you want it to feel thoughtful and personal.  
Most online tools provide generic suggestions that don't consider details like the recipient’s **age**, **interests**, or **your relationship** with them.

This project was built to solve exactly that.  
It provides tailored gift recommendations using specific filters — all wrapped in a cute, animated, and interactive interface.
